# Risk Calculation 

This document evaluates the risk level of each identified asset by calculating risk based on asset value, threat likelihood, and vulnerability severity. The formula used:

**Risk = Asset Value × Threat Likelihood × Vulnerability Severity**

| Asset Type | Asset                      | Asset Value (1–5) | Threat Likelihood (1–5) | Vulnerability Severity (1–5) | Risk Score | Priority Level |
