# Phase 2 – Risk and Compliance Assessment

This phase focuses on identifying and assessing the risks associated with all critical asset types within the simulated e-commerce environment. The risk assessment is performed **without any initial controls**, in order to realistically identify vulnerabilities, threats, and their potential impact. Following this, suitable **administrative, physical, and logical controls** are mapped to each asset category, in alignment with compliance frameworks such as **ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, DPDPA**, and the **IT Act 2000**.

## 📊 Phase Goals

- Identify all company assets across 6 categories
- Detect threats and vulnerabilities against each asset
- Calculate risk (likelihood × impact) with zero mitigation
- Map appropriate security controls to mitigate each risk
- Ensure alignment with industry-standard compliance frameworks
